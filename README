ABOUT: This project aims at creating an interactive menu for the Bukkit Minecraft Server.
With it you can currently start, stop, restart, and update bukkit server. 
It will run the server using screen. So if you are running the server remotely (example: through a ssh session) the server will continue to run even when you disconnect. When you connect again, simply start Ascii Bukkit Menu
again and it will reconnect to the exsiting session.

DEPENDENCIES:
	-Java Runtime Enviroment (http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
	-bash (http://www.gnu.org/s/bash/)
	-screen (http://www.gnu.org/s/screen/)
	-grep (http://www.gnu.org/s/grep/)

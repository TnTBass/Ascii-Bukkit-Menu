What is it?

Ascii Bukkit Menu is a Bukkit server manager. Written with bash, designed to be simple and robust. Should work out of the box on most distros. Specificly designed to run on a headless server via a ssh session.

Features:

Uses screen to keep server session running in background, can reconnect at anytime.
Start/Stop/Restart commands.
Send commands directly to bukkit server.
Automatically update Bukkit server to latest recommended.
Bukkit server log rotation. Rotates server.log on each start, keeps last 20 compressed.
If using Ramdisks, will automatically copy worlds between ramdisk and localdisk. Then runs an md5sum to verify consistency of the data.

First check to see you have the correct dependencies as listed above.
Make sure your user has +rx permissions to Ascii-Bukkit-Menu directory

chmod -R u+rx Ascii-Bukkit-Menu
chown -R you:yourgroup Ascii-Bukkit-Menu
If you come across an issue such as this:

$ Ascii-Bukkit-Menu/start.sh
Ascii-Bukkit-Menu/start.sh: line 4: include/config: No such file or directory
You need to run the start.sh script from within the Ascii-Bukkit-Menu.

$ cd Ascii-Bukkit-Menu
$ ./start.sh
This is something that should be resolved in the next release.
